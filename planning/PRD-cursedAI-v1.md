PRD-cursedAI-v1

One-line:
cursedAI is an infinite doomscroll of AI-generated images/videos ordered by community-rated cursedness, with a session-based depth meter and a “Too Uncursed Graveyard”.

Core:
- Single shared feed (no personalization in v1).
- Users rate cursedness 1–100 every 5–12 items.
- Cursedness meter resets every session (0% at top).
- Deeper scroll yields more cursed content via engine thresholds.
- Low-cursed content moves to Graveyard.
- Upload requires login; browsing/rating is anonymous.
- Moderation: reporting + admin hide/remove.
- Monetization: sticky ad + popup ads at depth milestones.

Explicitly not in v1:
- Comments, profiles, social graph.
