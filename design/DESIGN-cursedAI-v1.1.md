DESIGN-cursedAI-v1.1 — Dark + Subtle Jester Undertone

Jester here means: quiet irony, dry observation, subtle contempt, not clownish.
No loud jokes, no clown visuals, no glitch effects.

Color:
- Near-black background (cold, with subtle velvet undertone: deep green/purple/burgundy shadows)
- Off-white/bone text (not pure white)
- One degraded accent color only (tarnished gold / muddy purple / sickly burgundy)
Use accent sparingly: meter fill, slider thumb, rare highlights.

Typography:
- Neutral sans-serif.
- No horror fonts, no playful fonts.
- Copy tone is calm, observational, understated.

Layout:
- Single-column doomscroll.
- One dominant media item per row.
- Generous vertical spacing, slow intentional feel.
- Not a gallery. Not a grid.

Interactions:
- UI never celebrates progress.
- UI never explains “why”.
- UI proceeds calmly.

Ads:
- Intrusive but not flashy.
- Never disguised as content.

END.
